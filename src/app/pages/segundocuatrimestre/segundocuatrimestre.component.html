                    <strong>Do you know a Stan Lee?</strong>
                    <br> When we used to young, all we saw the movies of marvel or read comics as spiderman, iron-man, x-mens etc.
                    <br>The colorful Marvel Comics patriarch who helped usher in a new era of superhero storytelling and saw his creations become a giant influence in the movie business has died.

                    <strong>Can you tell how he die?</strong>
                    <br> Kirk Schneck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, tells CNN the comic giant was taken by ambulance from his Los Angeles home on Monday morning to Cedar's Sinai Medical Center, where he later died. The cause of death is not yet known,
                    according to Schneck.

                <p>
                    <strong>Can you tell me more about Stan?</strong>
                    <br>Lee began his career at what was then Timely Comics in 1939. Over the years he was a writer, editor and occasional illustrator. But, bored with the output, he was preparing to leave the company when history took a sudden turn.
                    Lee could write comics when she was 24 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The comic should be written as a single word, so from now on, I want you to remember it," he said in a YouTube video of 2012. "They're not funny books, they're not comic books, they're comic books! Remember that or incur my anger."
                    <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Do you are a Band Queen fan? I didn't use to like biographical movies about bands, but now I do.</strong>
                    <br>I had only low expectations before view the movie, because if you are freddy mercuri fan, you will not see a more perfect and imperfect rock and roll biopic than Bohemian Rhapsody, which does many things extremely well, other things
                    sort of average, and one thing flawlessly: capturing the immense charisma and panache of Queen singer Freddie Mercury.
                </p>

                <p class="pt-4">
                    <strong>Personally, I'd read the books of the band before I saw the movie.</strong>
                    <br> The scenes bookending the above-mentioned are much, much better. Bohemiam Rhapsody, buoyed as it is by a fantastic soundtrack (duh), soars on universally spot-on casting: May, played by Gwilym Lee, is nailed right down to his
                    clogs, bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) down to his ill-advised perm.

                <p>
                    The performance scenes, particularly the showpiece Live Aid concert, broadcast the excitement — and inherent fashion crimes — of eighties-era Wembley Stadium at full blast. (In subsequent interviews, Malek has confirmed this iconic scene of that iconic
                    performance was the first thing that was shot with the surviving members of Queen watching, further underscoring just how much he nailed it).
